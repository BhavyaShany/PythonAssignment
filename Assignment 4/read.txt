Weather Data Analysis Report

This project analyzes India’s weather data using Python to understand temperature, rainfall, and humidity patterns. The workflow includes data acquisition, cleaning, statistical summarization, and visualization.

1. Data Loading
The dataset is downloaded through KaggleHub and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Basic checks like head, info, and describe help verify the structure and quality of the data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Column names are standardized for consistency.
The script identifies and converts the date column, sorts the data, and sets it as the index.
Important weather metrics such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, and humidity are selected from the dataset using flexible column-name matching.

Missing values are handled using:
Forward and backward fill for temperature and humidity.
Zero-fill for rainfall, since missing rainfall usually indicates no recorded rain.
An optional city filter is applied; in this case, the analysis focuses on Delhi.

3. Statistical Analysis
Daily, monthly, and yearly statistics are computed with NumPy. These include mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for each weather metric.
This gives a clear summary of short-term and long-term weather trends.

4. Grouping and Aggregation
The data is grouped by:
Month for monthly behavior
Season (Winter, Pre-monsoon, Monsoon, Post-monsoon) for broader climate patterns
This highlights temperature peaks, humidity shifts, and rainfall concentration during monsoon months.

5. Exporting Results
The cleaned dataset is exported as cleaned_weather.csv for further use.
All plots are saved in the outputs/ directory.
